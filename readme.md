# TDD Animals

It's time to put your knowledge of Ruby and Rspec to the test and build an application strictly using TDD!

You want to write the least amount of code possible to make the tests pass.

Your application should consist of three classes:

#### 1. Animal

Each animal should have a/an:

- property called name
- property called age
- property called sleeping, which should have a default value of true
- instance method called wake_up which changes sleeping to false
- instance method called go_to_sleep which changes sleeping to true
- instance method called feed which returns "NOM NOM NOM" if the animal is not sleeping
	
#### 2. Dog

- should inherit from Animal
- has a class variable called favorite_treats which is an array of treats
- has an instance variable called favorite treat which is a random item in the favorite_treats array
- has an instance method called woof which returns "WOOF" if sleeping is not false
- has a class method which adds to the favorite_treats array
- has a class method which gets the favorite_treats array

#### 3. Cat 

- should inherit from Animal
- has an instance method called meow which returns "MEOW" if sleeping is not false


### Getting Started

- initialize an rspec application
- create the _spec.rb files necessary and include `require "spec_helper"` in each one
- start by writing tests! Remember, red -> green -> refactor
- see your tests fail and write the code necessary to make them pass

### What kind of tests should I write?

You have a tremendous amount of flexibility when writing these tests, but think carefully about what they should look like. Before you even start writing tests, think about what data you are going to need for your tests and how you are going to create sample data for your tests.

Next, take a look at the documentation for Rspec matchers. You should use truthiness matchers for booleans and object type matchers for instances of classes. 


### Bonus

1. Combine the wake_up and go_to_sleep instance methods into one method that toggles the sleeping state. 
2. Create a class method called `show_all_animals` which returns a new array of hashes that contain the following information
  - the name of the animal
  - the age of the animal
  - the class of the animal (Animal, Dog or Cat)
